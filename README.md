# AI assignment reflection

This assignment was very new to me because I had never had to replicate someone else's code solely based on AI capabilities. Throughout my experience working with AI, I discovered that there are both advantages and disadvantages to using AI.

First, I thought AI was pretty useful for generating code based on my instructions. For example, giving a general idea of what I want, such as the prompt "describe this data for me," resulted in a fairly detailed analysis that would have taken me about 30 minutes to complete manually.

However, there were a few dangers. First, I believe AI has advanced to the point where it understands the context of my inquiry even when I do not fully understand what I am looking for. For example, simply giving it the prompt, "Wrangle, explore, and model the given data to provide valuable business insights," I discovered that it does the majority of the analysis on its own. Given how advanced AI has become, I'm concerned that students and others will use it without fully understanding the code base or how to debug it when problems arise.

Similarly, when I asked it to do something specific, like reproduce code that was very similar to the original, it produced minor errors. For example, in my prompt, "Create a Seaborn scatter plot to identify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions," there was an error that produced the same color for different values in the legend. As a result, I was in charge of determining the source of the error and adding another prompt to ensure that the color was differentiated.

Although there are advantages and disadvantages to using AI, I believe it is critical to learn how to use it in today's competitive job market where everyone else is using it. However, I believe we should be A.I.-literate enough to know when we should and shouldn't use it.
